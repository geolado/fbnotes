FB DdoS tool
=======

based on : http://chr13.com/2014/04/20/using-facebook-notes-to-ddos-any-website

need :	pip install facebook-sdk
		pip install eventlet

Changes from the main PoC : 
1 - thread and sub-thread system
2 - Posting notes with FB API 

ps : Probably curl is a better way to do the requisition
